            Manga is the form in which Japanese comics or comics are known. The creator of the term "manga" (漫画) was <br>
            Hokusai Katsushika, a renowned painter of the Japanese ukiyo-e movement . <br>

            in the most literal sense as “informal drawings” or “doodles”. On the other hand, the author who is in <br>

            used to refer very specifically to the Japanese style of illustration and specifically Japanese comics. <br>

            <br>
            first steps of the manga are tied to two types of traditional artistic expressions: Japanese graphic art
            <br>
            dating from the XI and the indisputable influence of the world of Western comics, which had already won its

            place in the entertainment medium during the 19th century.
