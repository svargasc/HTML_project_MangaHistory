            That we like a good list , huh? And more when we talk about podiums. So, this time we bring you a list of <br>
            the 15 best sleeves in history . Be careful, this list corresponds to a compilation of votes by the users of <br>
            MyAnimeList , so it is a total average with which, obviously, we can agree or not. Next, we will go through <br>
            all the positions and, of course, we invite you to leave us your impressions and share your personal list <br>
            with us.
        </p>
