            <li>
                <h3>GTO (Great Teacher Onizuka)</h3>
                <p>
                    This manga by Tohru Fujisawa was published in the well-known Shonen Magazine, from the Kodansha <br>
                    publishing house. In Spain, it was partially published by Mangaline Ediciones, but it could not be <br>
                    completed due to various problems that sadly ended with the publisher. The story of this young <br>
                    22-year-old delinquent who, with nothing else to do in life, decides to become a high school <br>
                    teacher, surprised by its freshness, originality, humor and, above all, by the teachings that were <br>
                    basically dropped of his misadventures.<br>

                <h3>Made in Abyss</h3>
                <p>
                    This popular and tragic work by Tsukushi Akihito, published in our country by Ivrea, was one of the <br>
                    surprises in the world and, as a result of its wonderful anime, it began to increase in popularity<br>
                    until it became not only one of the best-selling manga in its country of origin, but also one of the<br>
                    most beloved. Despite its hardness, its interesting and mysterious plot, its fascinating abysmal<br>
                    world and how well the story is carried out make it one of the works of the moment on its own<br>
                    merits.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Monogatari Series</h3>
                <p>
                    NisioIsin's work was already enormously popular in Japan, its author being one of the best-selling<br>
                    light novels. Later, with the anime, she also captivated those who did not know her, who fell in<br>
                    love with her characters, her stories and her unique humor. As if this were not enough, then a manga<br>
                    adaptation (published in Spain by Milky Way) was announced by the incredible Ogure Ito, who knows<br>
                    how to capture in its pages the peculiar world that surrounds this work.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>20th Century Boys</h3>
                <p>
                    Everything that can be said at this point about Naoki Urasawa, the master of thriller manga, is<br>
                    already redundant. It is not surprising that we find this work on this list, since it is one of the<br>
                    most fascinating, addictive and well-run by the author. It is incredible how the mangaka knows how<br>
                    to combine the past, present and even the future without leaving any loose ends and astonishing the<br>
                    reader at every step he takes. In Spain, we currently have a wonderful kanzenban edition by Planeta.<br>

                <h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
                <p>
                    Possibly the most unknown work on the list. It is a manhwa (Korean manga) that is quite popular in<br>
                    the world. Despite the fact that the plot is already more than hackneyed (a loser protagonist who<br>
                    must become a hero), this work has captivated the public thanks to the charisma of its characters,<br>
                    its addictive entertainment factor and, above all, its incredible artistic style. It is the work of<br>
                    authors Jang, Sung Rak and Chugong.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="./images/img7.jpg" alt="">

            <li>
                <h3>Slam Dunk</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most iconic and remembered works in history and one of the fundamental pillars of the<br>
                    popular Shonen Jump in its day. The story of the badass Sakuragi, who goes through everything until<br>
                    the sport crosses his life, captivated everyone, lovers of spokon or not. This work of<br>
                    self-improvement, sacrifice and teamwork embodies the values ​​of a good manga like few others, as<br>
                    well as entertaining and teaching like no other. Kanzenban edition available in Spain, from Ivrea.<br>

                <h3>Grand Blue</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most modern works on the list, whose success was completely unexpected. Make no mistake,<br>
                    it is not a work for everyone. His humor is based on the most hyperbolic exaggeration, alcoholic<br>
                    jokes and fanservice galore. But perhaps these factors make it such a beloved series. Of course, it<br>
                    works great as light entertainment to have a few laughs, and if we add some learning about the world<br>
                    of scuba diving, we have a product whose success may not be so surprising. In Spain, it is licensed<br>
                    by Planeta Cómic.<br>

                <h3>Kingdom</h3>
                <p>
                    This manga by Hara Yasuhisa is one of the longest-running historical works in existence. It tells<br>
                    us, time and time, the history of the Chinese dynasty, with all its wars, important people,<br>
                    outstanding events and, above all, a very sincere brutality when it comes to reflecting the troubles<br>
                    of the battlefield. As soon as the subject catches your attention, you will be before a more than<br>
                    interesting work whose pages fly.<br>

            <li>
                <h3>Goodnight Punpun</h3>
                <p>
                    Probably the hardest and most heartbreaking work of Inio Asano, and this is saying a lot, since he<br>
                    usually permeates his narrative with decadence, melancholy and longing for a bygone time that was<br>
                    always better. Published in Spain by Norma Editorial, it is undoubtedly a work that will touch<br>
                    everyone who reads it.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="./images/img11.jpg" alt="">

            <li>
                <h3>Vagabond</h3>
                <p>
                    Double for Takehiko Inoue on this list. On this occasion, he turns to the historical genre to<br>
                    masterfully tell us the story of the well-known samurai Mushashi Miyamoto since his youth, without<br>
                    skimping on details, violence and a fast and dynamic narrative that hooks the reader from the first<br>
                    moment. An essential work from which you cannot take your eyes off. Ivrea was in charge of bringing<br>
                    her to Spain.<br>

                <h3>One Piece</h3>
                <p>
                    The best-selling and most popular work of all time (with permission in certain aspects of Kimetsu No<br>
                    Yaiba ). It was inevitable that he was on this list, since what Eiichiro Oda has achieved with his<br>
                    manga transcends otaku culture to enter the mass media and world popular culture on its own merits.<br>
                    A work charged with emotion, imagination and creativity that is impossible not to adore. The Straw<br>
                    Hat band has been able to settle forever in our hearts. Its publication is carried out by Planeta<br>
                    Cómic.

                <h3>Monster</h3>
                <p>
                    Inuoe is not the only doublet speaker on this list. Urasawa too, and with one of his most<br>
                    international and beloved works worldwide, Monster. The story of doctor Kenzo Tenma, who must choose<br>
                    between saving the life of a child and the powerful mayor, has also transcended manga culture and,<br>
                    on more than one occasion, its adaptation to a film in Hollywood has been hinted at. We'll see if<br>
                    the day finally comes... Available in kanzenban edition in Spain by Planeta.<br>

                <h3>Fullmetal Alchemist</h3>
                <p>
                    The work that raised Hiromu Arakawa to fame and, possibly, to the history of manga. The<br>
                    unforgettable trip of the Elric brothers made us all fall in love, and we immediately connected with<br>
                    their circumstances and accompanied them on this exciting adventure that combines drama, humor and<br>
                    action like few others with moments to remember that will remain forever in everyone's memory. . In<br>
                    Spain, Norma has also published a kanzenban edition of this work.<br>

                <h3>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</h3>
                <p>
                    We thought that we would never see this demanded work in Spain, but thanks to the risk that Ivrea<br>
                    took (which luckily turned out well) we can enjoy one of the most bizarre, fun and original stories<br>
                    in the world of manga. The Jojos have come to stay in the popular collective, although in reality...<br>
                    they have always been there.<br>

                <h3>Berserk</h3>
                <p>
                    We close the list of the 15 best manga in history with the cursed work, which seems to jinx every<br>
                    publisher that publishes it. However, there continues this story by Kentaro Miura who, at his slow<br>
                    pace, continues to build an excellent fantastic epic narrative. Perhaps that is why publishers do<br>
                    not stop betting on it despite everything that surrounds it and its exasperating rate of<br>
                    publication. Currently, Panini Manga is in charge of its publication, alternating between its new<br>
                    Maximum edition and the new regular volumes that are being released in Japan.<br>
